1. use traversal is best way to solve this problem. It's rare.
2. what shuld we do is just let the every last node's value smaller than after.
3. but don't forget the case root is -2^31. In this case, the root will even with Integer.MIN_VALUE than return false. So, just like we do in 3rd if case, skip the comparison between firstnode and Integer.MIN_VALUE.
