1. Integer.MIN_VALUE
2. because we need R2A(root-to-any point) to judge A2A(any-to-any), build a class ResultType to store two variables.
3. as you guess, build a helper to use ResultType.
4. deal with R2A first, then use it to find A2A.
5. R2A : find the bigger one between left.r2a + root.val and right.r2a + root.val. then let it at least even to 0.
6. A2A : don't forget to compare left.a2a with right.a2a first.
