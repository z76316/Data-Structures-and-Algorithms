Merge sort (divide and conquer):
    1. Find mid of lists. mid = len(lists) // 2
    2. Divide and conquer. left = self.mergeKLists(lists[:mid]), right = self.mergeKLists(lists[mid:])
    3. return merge(left, right)
    4. Merge is basic
    
Heap
    1. Don't forget "from heapq import heappush, heappop"
    2. Run a for loop to heappush(heap, (lists[i].val, i, lists[i]))
    3. The reason to store i into tuple is for comparison of heap between two equal val node
    4. While heap is not empty, keep run the while loop to heappop, heappush the minimum node and go to the next node
